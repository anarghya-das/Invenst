                        <p>Fitness related gears and Apps are gaining more and more popularity. Speedo has an App that
                            runs on Samsung's smart watch that records the number of laps in a pool. However, it works
                            only in free-style swimming mode and won't recognize the breaststroke motion at all. Given
                            the various built-in sensors available on this and other watches, it is possible to develop
                            an App that recognizes breaststroke.</p>

                        <p>Apps like "19 crimes" (now called Living Wine Label) use smartphones' built in cameras to

                            playing a video). I am not sure how difficult it is to develop a simple app like this from
                            scratch, but it would be nice to have a "framework" which could make such an app
                            development very easy by providing a library of functions that can be called by an app
                            developer such that all the developer needs to do is to specify what input(s) to use as a
                            trigger and what actions to perform. Here, the input could be an image of the object/label
                            captured by a camera, keywords associated with the object, or voice input containing some
                            keywords. The actions to perform can be as simple as playing a prerecorded youtube video or
                            displaying prerecorded background information on the object/product. </p><a class="getstarted"

                    <div class="fold">
                        <p>"Tab completion is a common feature in command-line interfaces. In bash, for example, if I
                            type:
                            `$> ec\t`
                            The command line gets replaced by:
                            `$> echo `
                            This is relatively easy to implement, as the semantics of command-line expressions are
                            positional: The first field is always a command, the second and subsequent fields are files
                            or arbitrary strings (admittedly newer versions of bash let you do more interesting
                            things). A language like SQL on the other hand is (1) stateful, (2) needs to draw in
                            external information about tables, columns, (3) also has to contend with name aliasing.
                            Concretely:
                            1) Statefulness
                            > SELECT * FROM X\t
                            Could be completed with the rest of the table name (i.e. ""Xtensions""), "", [another
                            table]"", or a SQL keyword ""FROM"", ""WHERE"". Typically when parsing the set of available
                            options is represented by a state in a finite state machine compiled from a user-provided
                            grammar.
                            2) External information
                            > SELECT foo\t
                            At this point in the query information comes from outside of the grammar: You need to query
                            the database to figure out which fields begin with 'foo'
                            3) Aliasing:
                            > SELECT foo.bar FROM myTable AS foo WHERE f\t
                            The fact that 'foo' is a table name comes from inside the query. In other words, you need
                            to partially parse the query to figure out how to parse the query completion.
                            In short, we're looking to add tab completion to Mimir (http://mimirdb.info). Mimir is
                            written in Java uses JLine3 to provide command line services (it has a completion widget).
                            It would be nice if we could trash our existing SQL parser and replace it with something
                            newer and more extensible as well."</p><a class="getstarted" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiT9sDnfxA61PEsG4-HcMIieiIj5tpLn-ThlE41pGrbOSD9Q/viewform?entry.972833926=Tab Completion">

                    </button>
                    <div class="fold">
                        <p>"Mimir is a database system that automatically ""repairs"" messy data and allows users to
                            query the fixed version. The gimmick is that we preserve the original values and other
                            possible repairs of the data. Right now, we can do two things:
                            - Query the most likely (Best Guess) repair
                            - Generate a set of sampled repairs
                            The goal of this project is to provide support for POSSIBLE and existential POSSIBLE
                            queries. A POSSIBLE query:
                            > SELECT POSSIBLE A, B, ... FROM ...
                            ... computes and returns the full set of results that could possibly appear from SELECT A,
                            B, ... FROM ... in any repair. Each tuple is emitted exactly once, regardless of how many
                            possible worlds it appears in (although different tuples with the same values may be
                            emitted). An optional CONF() function call emits the probability of that particular row
                            appearing.

                            The first goal would be to add support for POSSIBLE queries in Mimir. However, there are
                            two limitations to solely POSSIBLE queries. First, POSSIBLE queries are slow (they require
                            enumerating a very large state space). Second, in some cases (e.g. when a single problem
                            admits an infinite or continuous domain of repairs), POSSIBLE queries may produce an
                            infinite number of outputs.

                            The second goal then would be to combine POSSIBLE and existential (EXISTS) queries.
                            Concretely, an existential query
                            > EXISTS SELECT * FROM R WHERE A = 5
                            ... returns simply true or false – true if the select query has at least one result, false
                            otherwise. For example, the following query returns true if there is at least one row in R
                            where A = 5.
                            When combined with SELECT POSSIBLE queries, the resulting query essentially tests to see if
                            there is any possible circumstance under which the query could return some value. Such
                            queries are similar to why/why-not provenance, but not quite the same. Why/why-not
                            provenance allows a wide variety of database modifications to serve as causal explanations
                            (adding/removing tuples, changing values, etc...).

                        <p>"The goal of the project is to develop a nightmare-style browser automation library for
                            Kotlin. There are two things to explain here---one is what Kotlin is, and the other is what
                            I mean by a nightmare-style browser automation library. First, Kotlin
                            (https://kotlinlang.org) is a new language that has recently become one of the official
                            languages of Android. It has some nice language features such as static typing, null
                            safety, lambda functions, etc., but at the same time its grammar is concise. Because of
                            that, it can be used for quick prototyping (comparable to python) as well as serious
                            production development (comparable to Java).

                            Now, a browser automation library allows you to interact with a browser programatically.
                            For example, you can click web page buttons, fill out web forms, etc., all programmatically
                            using a browser automation library. This is good for web app testing as well as browser
                            task automation.

                            There is (as far as I know) no browser automation library for Kotlin yet. Since Kotlin is a
                            new language good for many things, I believe there has to be a browser automation library
                            for Kotlin as well. The model we can follow is a browser automation library called
                            nightmare (https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare). It provides a high-level API good
                            enough for simple task automation and testing.

                            There is a low-level browser automation library called Selenium Web Driver
                            (http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/). This can be used as an underlying library.

                            In summary, the goal is to develop a nightmare-style browser automation library for
                            Kotlin."</p><a class="getstarted" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiT9sDnfxA61PEsG4-HcMIieiIj5tpLn-ThlE41pGrbOSD9Q/viewform?entry.972833926=Kotlin Library">

                        <p>A contactless power monitoring solution for installation in a residential electrical system.
                            It would use current transformers to monitor the power usage on individual residential
                            circuits (either at the breaker panel or elsewhere) and provide the data in some
                            standardized form for local or cloud processing. There exist commercial solutions in this
                            space, but they are generally either a) very expensive (typically not intended for
                            residential use), b) proprietary cloud-based solutions with limited data protection or
                            access to raw data, or c) complicated inference-based collection (using, e.g., only the
                            incoming service lines for detection, not individual circuits), or even all of the above.</p>
                        <p><em>What might the team need to succeed?</em><br>A working knowledge of power systems
                            (including, but not limited to, basic electrical principles and AC concepts such as power
                            factor), data collection, electronics and software design.

                            For "product" quality design, many standards will have to be engaged, and likely
                            conformance testing from the FCC and an entity like UL. There are almost certainly NEC/NFPA
                            concerns as well.

                            The key for marketing of such a device would be ease of installation (either easy for a
                            homeowner or inexpensive to hire an electrician) and a simple interface for understanding
                            the collected data and its implications. Good engineering and HCI will be necessary.</p>
                        <p><em>What sort of team will it take?</em><br>EE, ME, CEng, and CS. The basic design is mostly
                            EE/ME, and then CEng/CS can take the collected data as far as they want.</p><a class="getstarted"

                            developed. Web app is a possibility, mobile app would be better and the addition of data
                            collection and analysis would make it truly spectacular. </p><a class="getstarted" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiT9sDnfxA61PEsG4-HcMIieiIj5tpLn-ThlE41pGrbOSD9Q/viewform?entry.972833926=The Happiness Experiment">

                        <p>A Google Chrome extension specifically to unify all of the functions of several University
                            at Buffalo services (HUB, myUB, UBLearns, UB Printing, etc.). A way to gather the most-used
                            tools for UB students and centralize it to a Chrome extension that makes it easier and more
                            accessible rather than have them split across different domains. Would be similar to the UB
                            Mobile app but a desktop version. Medium-sized project primarily based upon showcasing
                            features and maximizing student productivity. Other potential features could include:

                            – University at Buffalo news
                            – A list for upcoming UB events
                            – Calendar
                            – To-Do List
                            – Notifications when a notification appears on UBLearns or myHUB</p>

                            Google Chrome extension for the UB student body that maximizes student productivity. The
                            project should not take too long (5-10 weeks), it is a medium-sized project and would only
                            require (at least) an HTML file for the popup window, a CSS file for the style (Bootstrap
                            possibly), a manifest.json, and JavaScript files for different features.</p>
                        <p><em>What sort of team will it take?</em><br>Mainly a team of web developers/designers. The
                            knowledge required for this project would be mainly Google Chrome Extension knowledge,
                            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, jQuery, Bootstrap, etc. Additional knowledge would include:
                            web scraping, graphic design, etc.</p><a class="getstarted" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiT9sDnfxA61PEsG4-HcMIieiIj5tpLn-ThlE41pGrbOSD9Q/viewform?entry.972833926=UB Technology Unifier">

                            quickly and easily fill in that is also easily computer-interpreted from a scan. For
                            example, a bubble-form interface or a Person Number entry similar to Russian postal codes
                            (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Russia), along with the software to find and
                            read this data from a scanned assignment.

                            Ideally the header would either be modular or generated in some flexible markup system
                            (producing PDF, SVG, or similar, or embeddable directly in the assignment document; say,
                            LaTeX), so that professors could adopt their own exam formats and the software could still
                            locate and interpret the ID block. The associated software must be platform-independent and
                            either standalone (e.g., given a scanned exam on the command line, output either a person
                            number (perhaps with confidence) or a failure value) or an easily embedded library (a
                            Python or Java package, for example). While "platform independence" need not be universal,
                            it should certainly be able to be run on Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p><a class="getstarted"

                        <p>UBCarPool is currently a FaceBook page that serves as a medium for UB students to connect
                            with other UB students who are willing ride share, no matter how far the distance. Our goal
                            is to most effectively connect students to drivers and drivers to students, paving a way
                            for students to carpool with one another to any location. So if you would like to carpool
                            with someone who is driving to NYC, for example, we will make a post online for drivers to
                            see. Once a driver responds, we will connect them with the passenger who is willing to
                            share the cost of gas. Once they are connect, the students will be able to handle travels
                            from there. My goal is to put this service into an easily accessible and easy to use
                            application. If we can put it into an application, this idea will reach more people and the
                            act of connecting people and setting up rides can work more effectively through the
                            algorithms/ filters designed using the application. Eventually I would like to move this
                            application to other Universities, and eventually big businesses.

                            UB CarPool can help us all save money, save the environment, and meet new people!</p>
                        <p><em>What might the team need to succeed?</em><br>We will be working towards designing a
                            mobile app. I know how I would like it to be designed, however I am always open to
                            suggestions. It is a great idea to begin the app and market the idea and see how the UB
                            campus takes it. Within the app, I would like to conduct surveys, and charge fees/ receive
                            payment, and tasks that would make the app a success.

                            As a group, we all need hard work, dedication, and time in order to succeed. </p>
